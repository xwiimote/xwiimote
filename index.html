      <h2>XWiimote</h2>
      <p>
        XWiimote is an open-source linux device driver for Nintendo Wii / Wii U
        Remotes and
        <a href="#devices">compatible devices</a>. It is a relatively new driver
        that tries to supercede
        <a href="http://abstrakraft.org/cwiid/">cwiid</a>,
        <a href="http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Wiiuse">wiiuse</a> and others by
        integrating the driver into existing linux infrastructure. The project
        consists of an official linux
        <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/hid/hid-wiimote-core.c">kernel driver</a>,
        which is part of the kernel
        since linux-3.1, an extension to
        <a href="http://www.bluez.org">bluez</a>, the official linux bluetooth
        stack, an X11 input driver, some user-space helpers and test
        applications.

      <h3>How to use it?</h3>
      <p>
        To use Nintendo Wii Remotes, or any
        <a href="#devices">compatible device</a>, on linux, you need:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>linux kernel</strong> 3.1 or newer (<strong>3.11</strong>
              or newer recommended)</li>
          <li><strong>bluez</strong>-4.101 or newer (<strong>bluez-5.0</strong>
              or newer recommended)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>kernel drive</em>r is available since linux-3.1 upstream.
        However, you need at least <em>linux-3.11</em>
        for a hotplug-capable driver and proper device
        support. Older versions of the kernel driver are no longer recommended
        (still supported, but may lack important features). Most major
        distributions provide toose kernels out-of-the-box with the
        <strong>hid-wiimote</strong>
        driver enabled. But you might have to call
        <code>modprobe hid-wiimote</code>
        to load the driver manually.
        <br />
        The <em>bluez bluetooth stack</em> is the official linux bluetooth
        stack which
        is provided by all major distributions. Since <em>version 4.101</em>
        it includes
        fixes so Nintendo devices can be paired with linux hosts. If you use
        an older bluez version, you may still be able to use Nintendo
        Wii / Wii U devices, but you cannot pair them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you made sure you have the required software installed, you can
        start a bluetooth-manager of your choice (eg.,
        <a href="https://launchpad.net/blueman">blueman</a>,
        <a href="https://live.gnome.org/GnomeBluetooth">gnome-bluetooth</a>)
        and perform a bluetooth inquiry (ie., search for nearby devices). Your
        remotes will show up as <strong>Nintendo RVL-CNT-01</strong>
        (<em>Revolution</em> was the codename of the Nintendo Wii) or with
        slightly modified names (eg., the balance board shows up as
        <strong>Nintendo RVL-WBC-01</strong>). Select a device and connect to
        it. If you use a new enough bluez version, it will automatically select
        the
        correct PIN. If you are prompted for PIN input, your bluez stack is too
        old. In this case simply select <em>"Connect without PIN"</em> or
        <em>"Connect without Pairing"</em> as you cannot enter the required PIN
        via these interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you connected a device, the <em>hid-wiimote</em> kernel driver
        will pick it up and provide kernel input interfaces for it. As these
        interfaces are pretty useless on its own, you need a user-space
        application or driver that uses the device. The kernel interfaces
        provide the parsed data input (eg., accelerometer data, IR cam
        positioning information, ...) but do not apply any policy. So if you
        want to use your device to emulate mouse-input, you need a user-space
        driver which does exactly that. There is no sane generic way how X11
        or other applications could use this data, as it is very device
        specific.
        <br />
        The <strong>xwiimote tools</strong> provide a library and some
        programs
        to help application-developers use Nintendo Wii / Wii U remotes.
        It is highly recommended to install the
        <a href="http://github.com/dvdhrm/xwiimote">xwiimote-package</a>
        before using a device. It will install some X11 blacklists so your
        X-Server will not pick up those devices by default. It also provides
        a tool called <strong>xwiishow</strong>, which can be used for testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this point on, there are several ways to use the device:
        <ul>
          <li>Use <a href="#xwiishow">xwiishow</a> for testing</li>
          <li>Install <a href="#x11">xf86-input-xwiimote</a> to make X11 use
              the device as input device</li>
          <li>Use the device with an application that supports
              <em>xwiimote</em></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 id="xwiishow">xwiishow</h3>
      <p>
        Once you followed the instructions given above, you can use the
        <em>xwiishow</em> command-line program from the
        <em>xwiimote tools</em> project. Simply install the
        <a href="http://github.com/dvdhrm/xwiimote">xwiimote-package</a>
        and run <code>xwiishow list</code>. This will list all currently
        connected devices. Via <code>xwiishow &lt;num&gt;</code> you can open
        a device and see a visualization of all input events. Several hotkeys
        are available to control the device.
      </p>
      <p>
        A manpage <em>xwiishow(1)</em> is also provided which explains all
        hotkeys and command-line arguments.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 id="x11">X11 Input Driver</h3>
      <p>
        The <strong>xf86-input-xwiimote</strong> project provides an X11
        input driver so a Nintendo Wii / Wii U device can be used as X11
        input device. The project is still under development, but currently
        supports emulating arbitrary button and keyboard input and emulating
        a mouse with the accelerometer and Motion-Plus gyroscope. Install the
        <a href="http://github.com/dvdhrm/xf86-input-xwiimote">xf86-input-xwiimote</a>
        package and give it a try!

      <h3 id="devices">Supported Devices</h3>
      <p>
        Nintendo produced many different devices for the Wii and Wii U consoles
        and 3rd party companies continously produce new devices based on them.
        The <strong>XWiimote</strong> project tries to support all of the
        Bluetooth-based HID input devices, which currently includes:
        <ul>
          <li>Nintendo Wii Remote (Nintendo RVL-CNT-01)</li>
          <li>Nintendo Wii Remote Plus (Nintendo RVL-CNT-01-TR)</li>
          <li>Nintendo Wii Nunchuk Extension</li>
          <li>Nintendo Wii Classic Controller Extension</li>
          <li>Nintendo Wii Classic Controller Pro Extension</li>
          <li>Nintendo Wii Balance Board (Nintendo RVL-WBC-01)</li>
          <li>Nintendo Wii U Pro Controller (Nintendo RVL-CNT-01-UC)</li>
          <li>Nintendo Wii Guitar Extensions</li>
          <li>Nintendo Wii Drums Extensions</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that compatible 3rd-party devices are also supported. If you
        own a device that does not work, please let us know! We do our best
        to support all devices that are internally based on the Wii Remote.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Nintendo Wii U GamePad</strong> is not based on Bluetooth,
        but rather on <em>IEEE-802.11 wifi</em> and, thus, is not supported by
        <em>XWiimote</em>. However, there is ongoing work to reverse-engineer
        the device and we will try to provide a new driver for it when enough
        information is known. Contributions are highly welcome!
      </p>

        <h4>Language Bindings</h4>
        <p>
          There are several language bindings available so you can use
          libxwiimote from your favorite scripting language. The bindings are
          based on <em>swift</em> and developed separately on
          <a href="http://github.com/dvdhrm/xwiimote-bindings">Github</a>. We
          currently provide bindings for:
          <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Perl</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

          The
          <a href="http://github.com/dvdhrm/xwiimote-bindings">xwiimote-bindings repository</a>
          contains example scripts and
          documentation for the different bindings. They are currently
          maintained by Nicolas Adenis-Lamarre, who spent a lot of time
          developing them; Thank you very much!
