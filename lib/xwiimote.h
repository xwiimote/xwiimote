/**
 * @defgroup kernel Kernel ABI
 * Kernel ABI constants
 *
 * Several constants and objects that are used by the kernel to communicate
 * with user-space. These indirectly define the kernel ABI, which is guaranteed
 * to be stable at all times.
 * Note that the direct kernel ABI is defined through kernel headers. The ABI
 * defined here extends it with information that we also guarantee to be stable
 * but isn't part of the direct ABI.
 *
 * The kernel ABI is almost complete abstracted by this library so these
 * constants are only needed for integration into existing applications. You
 * should try to avoid them and use them only if you need direct kernel access.
 *
 * The kernel driver **hid-wiimote** provides connected Wii-Remotes, and all
 * Nintendo or 3rd party devices that are compatible (including balance-boards,
 * pro-controllers, gamepads, ...), as HID devices. All HID devices can be
 * found in /sys/bus/hid/devices/. The kernel creates one directory for each
 * device.
 * A wiimote compatible device (**wiimote**) can be detected via normal
 * udev-filters. The **subsystem** field is **hid** and the **driver** field is
 * **wiimote**. If both match, the device is guaranteed to be handled by the
 * hid-wiimote driver and compatible with this library.
 *
 * Each wiimote provides several sub-devices as child-devices of the HID node.
 * During device-setup and device-detection, the kernel sets up most of these
 * nodes and sends a **change** event on the HID device after it is done.
 * Userspace must react to this event by re-reading the device state. Otherwise,
 * userspace might miss some nodes.
 * For each hotpluggable sub-device (like extensions or motion-plus), the
 * kernel attaches/detaches such nodes during runtime. Userspace must use
 * udev-monitors to react to those events, if interested. All available
 * interfaces on the HID device are explained below. From now on we assume that
 * `/sys/bus/hid/devices/[dev]/` is a valid wiimote device.
 *
 * Global Interfaces
 * =================
 *
 * The following interfaces are always present, regardless of the device-type
 * and extension-type.
 *
 * devtype
 * -------
 *
 * The HID device has a **devtype** attribute which can be found in
 * `/sys/bus/hid/devices/[dev]/devtype`. This attribute provides a
 * newline-terminated string which describes the device-type. If
 * support for new devices is added to the kernel, new identifiers may
 * be added. Valid values are:
 *
 * * **pending**: Device detection is not done, yet. The kernel will
 *                send a **change** uevent after it is done. A device
 *                must not be in this state for longer than a few hundred
 *                milliseconds.
 *
 * * **unknown**: The device-type is unknown and couldn't be initialized.
 *                Such devices are normally useles and should be ignored
 *                by most applications.
 *
 * * **generic**: The device-type could not be detected, but the device
 *                was successfully initialized. That means, most standard
 *                interfaces are available on this device, but may not
 *                function properly.
 *                Nearly all interfaces are enabled for such devices so
 *                no special policies apply.
 *
 * * **gen1[num]**: First generation of Wii-Remotes. This is mostly
 *                  **gen10**, but there are also 1st-gen devices with
 *                  built-in motion-plus which might be reported as
 *                  **gen15** or similar.
 *                  Newer WiiRemotePlus devices with built-in motion-plus
 *                  extensions belong to the 2nd-gen devices, though.
 *                  Nearly all interfaces are enabled for such devices.
 *
 * * **gen2[num]**: Second generation of Wii-Remotes. These are
 *                  guaranteed to have motion-plus built-in and use a
 *                  different bluetooth-chipset. Hence, there VID/PID
 *                  changed and a few details differ to gen1 devices.
 *                  Nearly all interfaces are enabled for such devices.
 *
 * * **balanceboard**: Balance-boards and compatible devices. Nearly no
 *                     interfaces are available on balance-boards. They
 *                     are limited to an extension port (which is
 *                     normally occupied by the balance-board extension),
 *                     one LED and the battery interface. No MotionPlus
 *                     is available.
 *
 * * **procontroller**: Wii-U Pro Controller and compatible devices.
 *                      Nearly no interfaces are available. One extension
 *                      port is supported (which is normally occupied by
 *                      the pro-controller extension), 4 LEDs and a
 *                      battery. MotionPlus may be available but is
 *                      currently not supported.
 *
 * Note that this attribute does not describe the extensions. Instead,
 * it describes the type of device. So users might build custom
 * extensions which allow a balance-board extension to be plugged on
 * a regular WiiRemote. This would cause **devtype** to be **gen10** but
 * **extension** to be **balanceboard**.
 *
 * extension
 * ---------
 *
 * An **extension** attribute is provided as
 * `/sys/bus/hid/devices/[dev]/extension` and provides a newline-terminated
 * string that describes the currently attached extension. New identifiers
 * might be added if we add support for new extensions to the kernel driver.
 * Note that normal Wii-Remotes provide a physical I2C extension port, but
 * other devices might not. So if **devtype** reports a different device-type
 * than a normal Wii-Remote, the extension might be built-in and not physically
 * unpluggable. Valid values are:
 *
 * * **none**: No extension is plugged.
 *
 * * **unknown**: An unknown extension is plugged or the driver
 *               failed to initialize it.
 *
 * * **nunchuk**: A Nintendo Nunchuk extension is plugged.
 *
 * * **classic**: A Classic Controller or Classic Controller Pro
 *                extension is plugged.
 *
 * * **balanceboard**: A balance-board extension is plugged. This is
 *                     normally a built-in extension.
 *
 * * **procontroller**: A pro-controller extension is plugged. This is
 *                      normally a built-in extension.
 *
 * Device-dependant interfaces
 * ===========================
 *
 * The following interfaces depend on the device-type. They may be present,
 * depending on the device. However, not that even if they are present, they
 * are not guaranteed to be physically available. For instance, many 3rd
 * party-device pretend to have a built-in battery, but do not report real
 * battery-capacity values. Instead they return a constant or fake value.
 * All the following interfaces are created during device-detection. After
 * device-detection is done, a **change** uevent is sent. Device-detection is
 * normally performed only once, but may be triggered via debug-hooks from
 * user-space at any time. Applications should be aware of that.
 *
 * Battery
 * -------
 *
 * A **power_supply** device is available as
 * `/sys/bus/hid/devices/[dev]/power_supply/wiimote_battery_[bdaddr]/`
 * and the interface is defined by the kernel **power_supply** interface.
 * *[bdaddr]* is the bluetooth-address of the remote device.
 *
 * LEDs
 * ----
 *
 * Player-LEDs on a device are available as
 * `/sys/bus/hid/devices/[dev]/leds/[dev]:blue:p[num]/` and the interface
 * is defined by the kernel **led** interface. *[dev]* is the same as the
 * device-name. *[num]* can be any non-negative integer and defines which LED
 * this is. Normally these are 0-3 for the 4 player-LEDs which can be found on
 * any Nintendo Remote. However, newer hardware may use more or less LEDs or
 * skip some (unlikely).
 *
 * Input: Core
 * ----------
 *
 * Input-Core: Core input device. It is available as
 * `/sys/bus/hid/device/[dev]/input/input[num]/` and can be detected via the
 * device name @ref XWII_NAME_CORE.
 *
 * TODO: Describe the provided interface
 *
 * Input: Accelerometer
 * --------------------
 *
 * Input-Accel: Accelerometer input device. Available as
 * `/sys/bus/hid/device/[dev]/input/input[num]/` and can be detected via the
 * device name @ref XWII_NAME_ACCEL. If this input-interface is not opened by
 * user-space, the accelerometer on the remote is disabled to save energy.
 *
 * TODO: Describe the provided interface
 *
 * Input: IR
 * ---------
 *
 * IR input device. It is available as
 * `/sys/bus/hid/device/[dev]/input/input[num]/` and can be detected via the
 * device name @ref XWII_NAME_IR. If this input-interface is not opened by
 * user-space, the IR-cam on the remote is disabled to save energy.
 *
 * TODO: Describe the provided interface
 *
 * Motion-Plus Interfaces
 * ======================
 *
 * The following interfaces belong to motion-plus capabilities. Motion-Plus
 * extension may be hotplugged or built-in. Even if built-in, they are handled
 * as special hotplugged extensions. So if you want to use Motion-Plus, you
 * must handle uevents properly.
 * As MotionPlus hotplug events are not generated by the device, the kernel
 * driver needs to periodically poll for them (only if not built-in). Hence,
 * hotplug-events may be delayed by up to 5s.
 * MotionPlus and related hardware is often abbreviated with **MP** or **M+**.
 *
 * Input: MP
 * ---------
 *
 * Motion-Plus input device. Is is available as
 * `/sys/bus/hid/device/[dev]/input/input[num]/` and can be detected via the
 * device name @ref XWII_NAME_MOTION_PLUS. If this input-interface is not
 * opened by user-space, the MP device is disabled to save energy. While the
 * interface is opened, MP hardware hotplug events are generated by the remote
 * device so we don't need to poll for MP availability.
 *
 * TODO: Describe the provided interface
 *
 * Extension Interfaces
 * ====================
 *
 * The following interfaces are extension interfaces. They are created whenever
 * an extension is hotplugged to a device. Only one extension-port is currently
 * available on each hardware (exposed via **extension** attribute), but newer
 * hardware may introduce more ports. Therefore, these extension might be
 * available simultaneously. However, in this case additional **extension2**
 * or similar attributes will also be introduced.
 * Note that some devices have built-in extensions which cannot be hotplugged.
 * But these extensions are handled as if they were normal hotpluggable
 * extensions.
 *
 * Extension-changes are advertized via udev uevents. The remote device sends
 * hotplug-events for regular extensions so they are deteced immediately (in a
 * few hundred milliseconds).
 * Note that devices are not initialized unless userspace opens them. This
 * saves energy as we don't need to power them up or stream any data.
 *
 * Input: Nunchuk
 * --------------
 *
 * Nunchuk extension input device. Available as
 * `/sys/bus/hid/device/[dev]/input/input[num]/` and can be detected via the
 * device name @ref XWII_NAME_NUNCHUK.
 *
 * TODO: Describe the provided interface
 *
 * Input: Classic Controller
 * -------------------------
 *
 * Classic Controller extension input device. Available as
 * `/sys/bus/hid/device/[dev]/input/input[num]/` and can be detected via the
 * device name @ref XWII_NAME_CLASSIC_CONTROLLER. The Classic Controller Pro is
 * also reported via this interface, but cannot be distinguished from a normal
 * classic controller extension.
 *
 * TODO: Describe the provided interface
 *
 * Input: Balance Board
 * --------------------
 *
 * BalanceBoard extension input device. Available as
 * `/sys/bus/hid/device/[dev]/input/input[num]/` and can be detected via the
 * device name @ref XWII_NAME_BALANCE_BOARD.
 *
 * TODO: Describe the provided interface
 *
 * Input: Pro Controller
 * ---------------------
 *
 * Wii-U Pro Controller extension input device. Available as
 * `/sys/bus/hid/device/[dev]/input/input[num]/` and can be detected via the
 * device name @ref XWII_NAME_PRO_CONTROLLER.
 *
 * TODO: Describe the provided interface
 *
 * Input: Drums Controller
 * ---------------------
 *
 * Drums controller extension input device. Available as
 * `/sys/bus/hid/device/[dev]/input/input[num]/` and can be detected via the
 * device name @ref XWII_NAME_DRUMS.
 * The different available devices are handled by the kernel and provided as
 * vendor-generic controller.
 *
 * TODO: Describe the provided interface
 *
 * Input: Guitar Controller
 * ---------------------
 *
 * Guitar controller extension input device. Available as
 * `/sys/bus/hid/device/[dev]/input/input[num]/` and can be detected via the
 * device name @ref XWII_NAME_GUITAR.
 * The different available devices are handled by the kernel and provided as

/**
 * @defgroup device Device Interface
 * Communication between applications and devices
 *
 * The device interface provides a way to communicate with a connected remote
 * device. It reads events from the device and provides them to the application.
 * But it also allows applications to send events to devices.
 *
 * Note that devices cannot be connected or searched for with this API. Instead,
 * you should use your standard bluetooth tools to perform a bluetooth inquiry
 * and connect devices. You do the same with bluetooth keyboards and mice, don't
 * you?
 *
 * If you want to enumerate connected devices and monitor the system for hotplug
 * events, you should use the @ref monitor "monitor interface" or use libudev
 * directly.
 *
 * The device interface is split up into different sub-interfaces. Each of them
 * is related to specific hardware available on the remote device. If some
 * hardware is not present, the interfaces will not be provided to the
 * application and will return -ENODEV.
 *
 * Interfaces must be opened via xwii_iface_open() before you can use them. Once
 * opened, they return events via the event stream which is accessed via
 * xwii_iface_dispatch(). Furthermore, outgoing events can now be sent via the
 * different helper functions.
 * Some interfaces are static and don't need to be opened. You notice it if no
 * XWII_IFACE_* constant is provided.
 *
 * Once you are done with an interface, you should close it via
 * xwii_iface_close(). The kernel can deactivate unused hardware to safe energy.
 * If you keep them open, the kernel keeps them powered up.
